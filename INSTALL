
 To install the OpenGL::Shader module, please follow these instructions:

 1. Install the OpenGL module first - you need at least version 0.55
    See the Perl OpenGL (POGL) Developer's Site:
    http://graphcomp.com/opengl
 
 2. Run 'perl Makefile.PL'

 3. Run 'make' ('nmake' on Windows).
 
 4. Run 'make test' ('nmake test' on Windows).
    Note: to run this test, you must have GLUT installed, and be able to create
    a GL context (window).
 
 5. If all is well, run 'sudo make install' ('nmake install' on Windows)
    to install OpenGL::Shader on your system.
